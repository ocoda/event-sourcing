# Welcome to Ocoda Event Sourcing

**Ocoda Event Sourcing** is a powerful library designed to simplify the implementation of advanced architectural patterns in your **NestJS** application. It provides essential building blocks to help you implement **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, leveraging **Event Sourcing** and **CQRS** to tackle the complexities of modern systems.

Whether you're building microservices, event-driven systems, or simply want a clean and scalable architecture, this library offers the tools you need to create maintainable, business-aligned solutions.

## Why Use Ocoda Event Sourcing?

While NestJS provides the [`@nestjs/cqrs`](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/cqrs) library for basic CQRS functionality, Ocoda Event Sourcing goes beyond by focusing on **Domain-Driven Design** and offering deeper integration with **Event Sourcing**. It gives you a more feature-rich framework to tackle complex business logic, ensure consistency, and manage state in a more scalable and flexible way.

### Key Features:
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Implement core DDD principles with ease, including aggregates, value objects, and repositories.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Cleanly separate the responsibility of handling commands and queries for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Event Sourcing**: Capture every change in your system as an immutable event, allowing you to rebuild the entire state and maintain a full audit trail.

## What You'll Find Here

This documentation is focused on guiding you through using the library to implement **DDD**, **Event Sourcing**, and **CQRS** in your NestJS projects. While it doesn't dive deeply into explaining these concepts, we provide:

- **Step-by-step usage guides** to help you integrate the library seamlessly into your application.
- A brief overview of the core patterns—DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing—in the [Patterns](/patterns/ddd) section for those who need a quick refresher.
- A curated list of resources for deeper learning on the [Further Reading](/further_reading) page.
